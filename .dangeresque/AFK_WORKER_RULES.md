# AFK Worker Rules

**This file applies to AFK dangeresque runs only, not interactive sessions.**

Read your project's CLAUDE.md first. This file overrides specific directives for bounded AFK execution.

## Directive Overrides

These common CLAUDE.md directives are modified for AFK mode:

| Interactive Directive | AFK Override | Reason |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|
| "Discuss with user first" | **STAY-IN-SCOPE** — Follow the GitHub Issue exactly. Do not widen scope. If blocked, stop and write findings instead of guessing. | No human to discuss with during AFK execution. |
| "Document immediately" | **WRITE-HANDOFF** — Write your run result file (path given in the initial prompt) before ending. This is your primary output. | Handoff artifacts replace live documentation. |
| "Push back / challenge" | **CHALLENGE-IN-WRITING** — If you disagree with the hypothesis or approach, document your objection in the run result file with evidence. Do not silently comply with a bad plan. | No human to push back against, but objections must be recorded. |

All other CLAUDE.md directives apply as written.

## One Mode Per Run

Each AFK run operates in exactly ONE mode. The mode is provided via CLI flag.

| Mode | Purpose | You May | You May NOT |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **INVESTIGATE** | Find root cause, trace flow | Read files, grep, analyze, write findings | Change code, close issues |
| **IMPLEMENT** | Bounded code change | Edit code, write tests, commit | Widen scope beyond the GitHub Issue |
| **VERIFY** | Prove a change works | Run tests, grep values, check state | Write new features, refactor |
| **REFACTOR** | Restructure without behavior change | Move/rename/reorganize code | Change behavior, add features |
| **TEST** | Write tests for existing behavior | Create test files, run them | Change production code |

Projects may define additional custom modes in their copy of this file.

## Scope Rules

- Stay within the GitHub Issue. Period.
- **One run = one slice.** Complete the scoped slice, not the entire issue, unless the issue IS a single slice.
- Do not try to solve the entire GitHub Issue unless it explicitly scopes you to do so.
- If you discover a related problem, note it in your run result file under "Risks / Uncertainty" — do not fix it.
- If the task is blocked (missing tool, unclear spec, needs human decision), stop and report. Do not guess.
- **Declare every file you touch.** For IMPLEMENT, REFACTOR, and TEST modes, the run result file MUST include a `## Scope Declaration` section listing every changed file with a category (`declared` / `extension` / `opportunistic` / `incidental`) and rationale. Phase 2 logs a warning when missing — Phase 3 will hard-fail. See worker-prompt.md for the format.

## File Scope Enforcement

- **DO NOT modify, delete, or create files outside the scope defined in the GitHub Issue.**
- If you see code that looks wrong but isn't part of your issue — leave it alone. Note the concern in your run result file under "Observations", do not fix it.
- If the issue says "only touch test files", that means ZERO changes to production code.
- **Deleting files you did not create in this run is NEVER acceptable** unless the issue explicitly requires deletion.
- Your worktree branched from `origin/HEAD` at creation time. Other workers may have merged changes to main since then. Code that looks unfamiliar may reflect work from another branch — DO NOT revert or "fix" it.
- The run result file lives inside your worktree at `.dangeresque/runs/issue-<N>/…` and is gitignored. Do NOT `git add` or `git commit` it — gitignore would block it anyway. Dangeresque mirrors the file out of your worktree to the project root at merge time.

## Worktree Write Fence

- All `Write`, `Edit`, and `NotebookEdit` calls MUST target paths inside your worktree. Compute every absolute path from your current working directory (the worktree root) — never hardcode an absolute path remembered from another repo or use `..` to climb out.
- Under the **claude** engine, a `PreToolUse` hook rejects parent-repo paths with exit code 2 and a message naming the offending path. Re-route to a worktree-relative absolute path and try again.
- Under the **codex** engine, the `--full-auto` workspace-write sandbox enforces the same boundary at the engine layer.
- The check is a simple absolute-path prefix comparison. It does NOT resolve symlinks or `..` traversal — those are out of scope (threat model is misrouted-but-well-meaning workers, not adversarial evasion).
- See `worker-prompt.md` § Path Discipline for the full failure-mode rationale (CI poisoning, invisible-to-diff stray files).

## Status Language

Use ONLY these statuses in your run result file:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `investigating` | Still gathering information, no conclusion yet |
| `implementing` | Code changes in progress, not yet complete |
| `implemented, unverified` | Code changed but full verification not completed |
| `verified` | Change made AND original behavior rechecked successfully |
| `blocked` | Cannot proceed — missing tool, unclear spec, or dependency |
| `reverted` | Change attempted but rolled back due to problems |

**Forbidden language:** Do not use "fixed", "done", "should work now", or any equivalent. These overclaim. If you cannot recheck the original behavior, use `implemented, unverified`.

## Required Outputs

Before ending your session, you MUST:

1. Write your run result file (absolute path from the initial prompt) with all required sections, starting with the `<!-- SUMMARY -->` block (see worker-prompt.md)
2. `git add` your code changes + `git commit` them in the worktree. The run result file is gitignored and cannot be staged.
3. Your commit message should summarize what was done

## Stop Conditions

Stop immediately if:
- You have completed the task as specified in the GitHub Issue
- You are blocked and cannot proceed
- You realize the hypothesis in the GitHub Issue is wrong (write CHALLENGE-IN-WRITING)
- You have exceeded the scope of the GitHub Issue
